* Pocket Emacs goes to India
   [[./gemini-in-action-india-2018/gemini-in-action.html][Slides]] for a talk given to the Berlin Emacs User Group in December 2018.

* Preparing a slide presentation
I prepare slides using the following software packages, which run
natively on Android in the [[https://termux.com/][Termux]] environment.

 - [[https://termux.com][Termux]]       :: Android app providing a Linux environment                       
 - [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs][Emacs 26.1]]   :: An extensible, customizable, free/libre text editor â€” and more  
 - [[http://spacemacs.org][Spacemacs]]    :: A nice set of curated packages for Emacs                        
 - [[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]]     :: The Emacs-hosted killer app                                     
 - [[https://revealjs.com][reveal.js]]    :: The HTML presentation framework                                 
 - [[https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal][Org reveal]]   :: A reveal.js exporter for Org mode                               

Slide presentations run directly on the Gemini in the native web browser.

* Android Screen Sharing
When presenting I want to show the PDA screen. I use [[https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy][Scrcpy]] over
USB with the PDA connected to my laptop. The laptop is connected to the
projector. This method is the most reliable because I don't have to worry about
Wifi or HDMI problems and I also have the laptop as a backup for the
presentation. USB tethering seems faster than Wifi but I haven't measured anything.

These screen sharing options work reasonably well.
-  [[https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy][Scrcpy]]      :: Open source. Mirror the Android stream over USB or Wifi.
-  [[https://store.planetcom.co.uk/collections/accessories/products/gemini-hdmi-video-cable][HDMI dongle]] :: Direct HDMI connection to the projector from the PDA.
-  [[https://www.vysor.io/][Vysor]]       :: Commercial mirroring solution similar to Vysor.
