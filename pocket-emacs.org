My Pocket Emacs device is the [[https://store.planetcom.co.uk/products/gemini-pda-1][Gemini PDA]], an Android smartphone with an
integrated hardware keyboard.

** [[./gemini-in-action-india-2018/gemini-in-action.html][Emacs, India and Geminis -- Pocket Emacs goes to India]]
  Slides for a talk given to the Berlin Emacs user group in December 2018.

  The slides were prepared with help of the following software, all of which
  runs natively on Android in the [[https://termux.com/][Termux]] environment.

| [[https://termux.com][Termux]]     | an Android app providing a Linux environment |
| [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs][Emacs 26.1]] |                                              |
| [[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]]   | the Emacs-hosted killer app                  |
| [[http://spacemacs.org][Spacemacs]]  | a nice set of curated packages for Emacs     |
| [[https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal][Org reveal]] | a reveal.js exporter for Org mode            |

 [[https://revealjs.com][reveal.js]], an HTML presentation framework

[[./gemini-in-action-india-2018/gemini-in-action.html][The presentation]] ran directly on the Gemini in a web browser. I also
   demonstrated using Emacs on the Gemini. The Android screen was streamed via
   [[https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy][Scrcpy]] over USB to my MacBook and thence to the data projector. There are
   other ways to achieve this, for example [[https://www.vysor.io/][Vysor]] which works over Wifi or a
   direct connection to the projector from the Gemini's [[https://store.planetcom.co.uk/collections/accessories/products/gemini-hdmi-video-cable][HDMI dongle]].
